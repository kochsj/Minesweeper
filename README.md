# Download and Play!
This is my first forray into learning to speak C# and is fully for educational purposes. No certificate present (for now) - You may need to tell your computer to trust this file to play ;)
### Windows Users:
1) Click the MinesweeperSK.exe file and click download.
2) When the .exe is finished downloading, open the file
### MacOS users:
A bit more difficult.
1) You will need [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/). Download for Mac.
2) After that, click "Clone or download" button here. Download ZIP.
